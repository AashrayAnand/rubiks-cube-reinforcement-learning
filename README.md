# Reinforcement Learning: Solving the Rubik's Cube

##*"A generally intelligent agent must be able to teach itself how to solve problems in complex domains with minimal human supervision." -S. McAleer"*##

 This project is an attempt to represent and solve the classic Rubik's cube

To solve the problem of a Rubik's cube, we implemented **feature-based Q-Learning**, a powerful reinforcement learning technique, as well as **the utilization of a pattern database**, to quantify the quality of near-finished cubes

this project assumes that a Rubik's cube can *only execute 180 degree side turns*, which greatly reduces the *branching factor* of the cube's *state space tree*

this project also attempts to reach a solution for a solved cube which has had *n random moves executed on it*, this value n
currently can be up to 5 to find a goal state for each execution, or in the range of 6-10 to be somewhat successful

> **puzzle.py** includes the state representation of a Rubik's Cube, **State()**, as well as a few auxillary functions
that are used elsewhere in the application

> **tests.py** includes a variety of test cases that can be executed to confirm the valid implementation of the cube's state represention

> **Agent.py** includes the implementation of a reinforcement learning agent, which executes iterations of Q-Learning, and additionally uses a pattern database, to build up a Q-Table, which is used to eventually try to solve the given random Rubik's cube

### Using this project

clone the repository and verify you have python3 installed 

` python Agent.py (will run Q-Learning on a n=5 scrambled cube, and attempt to solve it) `

to change the number of moves to apply to the initial cube, change **n=5** to any value on the below line in Agent.py

` 22    self.start_state = cube if cube is not None else n_move_state(n=5) `
